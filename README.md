## Build
In case you go with [Zephyr](https://zephyrproject.org/), use `west` which is
Zephyr's meta tool. Please refer to [Zephyr's Getting Started
Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html).

Please check out our getting started guide under [docs/boards](docs/boards) for
other RTOSs or bear metal firmwares.
